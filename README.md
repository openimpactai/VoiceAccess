VoiceAccess is an open-source project dedicated to bringing automatic speech recognition (ASR) to low-resource and endangered languages. By leveraging transfer learning, data augmentation, and community collaboration, we aim to preserve linguistic diversity and enable technology access for underserved communities.

## 🎯 Mission

Our mission is to democratize speech recognition technology by:
- Providing state-of-the-art ASR models for languages with limited training data
- Enabling rapid adaptation of existing models to new languages
- Building tools that respect and preserve linguistic diversity
- Creating an inclusive platform for community-driven language preservation

## ✨ Key Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Adapt pre-trained models (Wav2Vec2, Whisper, Conformer) to new languages with minimal data
- **Data Augmentation**: Advanced techniques to enhance limited training datasets
- **Multi-Language Support**: Framework designed for easy addition of new languages
- **Low-Resource Optimization**: Efficient models that work with as little as 1 hour of transcribed audio
- **Community Tools**: Easy-to-use interfaces for non-technical language communities
- **Modular Architecture**: Plug-and-play components for custom ASR pipelines

## 📊 Performance

| Language Type | Training Data | WER | CER |
|--------------|---------------|-----|-----|
| High-resource | >100 hours | 8-12% | 2-4% |
| Medium-resource | 10-100 hours | 15-25% | 5-10% |
| Low-resource | 1-10 hours | 25-40% | 10-20% |
| Zero-shot | 0 hours | 40-60% | 20-35% |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/openimpactai/VoiceAccess.git
cd VoiceAccess

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install VoiceAccess
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from voiceaccess import ASREngine, Config

# Load configuration
config = Config.from_file("configs/default.yaml")

# Initialize ASR engine
engine = ASREngine(config)

# Load a pre-trained model
engine.load_model("models/wav2vec2-base.pt", model_type="wav2vec2")

# Transcribe audio
transcription = engine.transcribe("path/to/audio.wav")
print(transcription)
```

### Adapt to a New Language

```python
# Adapt model to a new language
engine.adapt_to_language(
    language_code="xyz",  # Your language code
    adaptation_data_path="data/xyz_language/"
)

# Save adapted model
engine.model.save_checkpoint("models/wav2vec2-xyz-adapted.pt")
```
